# live-addons

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/CoderDojoPotsdam/live-addons.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/CoderDojoPotsdam/live-addons)

These are the live addons we use for the CoderDojo live ubuntu USB sticks.

## Download and Install

You can [download][releases]

- the file `z-coderdojo.squashfs` and put it into the 
  folder `casper` next to the `filesystem.squashfs` file.
- the ready made iso image.

## How It Works

We use [live-addon-maker][lam] to create the file you can downloaf from the relases.
